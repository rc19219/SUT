#  Renewal Deadlines, Forms and Online Services
The Office of Finance expresses our appreciation to all of you who file your business tax renewals on time. 
All businesses are required to file an annual tax renewal regardless of whether or not your business generated revenue for that tax year. Filing your renewals timely avoids late penalties and fees and also ensures that you can take advantage of all available tax credits and incentives. Business tax exemptions, such New Business, Small Business with global gross receipts less than $100,000, and Creative Artist require timely filing of renewals. 
To help you avoid missing any deadlines, we built the Finance Calendar to provide you automated renewal notices to your phone or PC. After you open the Finance Calendar, just click on the "+" bottom right of your screen to add it to your personal calendar.
