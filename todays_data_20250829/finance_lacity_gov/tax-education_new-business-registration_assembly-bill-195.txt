#  Assembly Bill 195
AB 195 changes the application of the State's Excise Tax on cannabis business activity. The new law does not change the City of Los Angeles' tax code or how it is implemented. Consistent with how the City's Gross Receipts Tax has been implemented in the past, receipts collected in order to pay State Excise Tax are considered part of gross receipts, and are taxable under the City's code. The example below shows how this is applied. We've also provided a link to City's Cannabis Tax Compliance Guide for your reference. For further information about the Office of Finance and the City's Business Tax, please visit[ finance.lacity.org](http://finance.lacity.org/). Please note that the application of the State Excise Tax has changed -- for information, details, and examples of those changes, please see the CDTFA website at [https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis](https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/industry/cannabis.htm).

Note - All receipts generated from cannabis activity should be included in the calculation of gross receipts. This includes any excise tax, other tax, and fees collected. Only Sales Tax is excluded from Gross Receipts.
Note - The total Excise & Sales Tax shown is for example purposes only. Please see the CDTFA website for Excise & Sales Tax Computation.
## Senate Bill 1059
### RE: IMPORTANT TAX UPDATES RELATED TO THE PASSAGE OF CALIFORNIA SENATE BILL 1059 (SB 1059) FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES
  
On September 28, 2024, Governor Newsom signed California Senate Bill 1059 (SB 1059) which added new section 16005 to the California Business and Professions Code. The changes introduced by the bill will directly impact how cannabis operators calculate and report their taxable receipts. The City will abide by the dictates of SB 1059 so long as it remains California law.
### Summary of Changes under SB 1059:
  1. Effective Date:The provisions of SB 1059 will take effect on January 1, 2025. The updated methodology will apply to the February 2025 tax filing deadline, which pertains to receipts from January 2025. Cannabis operators should ensure they
  2. Excise Tax Exclusion Starting January 1, 2025:
  3. Excise Tax Inclusion until December 31, 2024:calculating taxes as City law requires. The excise tax must continue to be factored into gross receipts for City tax reporting purposes until the end of this year.
  4. City-Imposed Taxes Remain Taxable: While SB 1059 provides that the state excise tax will no longer be included in computing and measuring a cannabis operator’s


To ensure compliance, we recommend that Cannabis operators review SB 1059 with your tax advisor (if any) and begin reviewing their tax practices. This includes preparing to adjust how taxable receipts are calculated starting in 2025 and ensuring that excise tax is properly included in receipts until the end of 2024.
### Examples of these calculations are provided below as a reference guide only.
