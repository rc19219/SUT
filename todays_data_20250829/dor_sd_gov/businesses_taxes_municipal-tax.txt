# Municipal Tax
The South Dakota Department of Revenue is the administrative and enforcement agency for municipal sales or use tax, and gross receipts tax. [SDCL 10-52](http://sdlegislature.gov/statutes/Codified_laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Statute=10-52&Type=Statute "SDCL 10-52")
South Dakota law allows municipalities to impose a municipal sales or use tax, and gross receipts tax. Businesses report municipal sales tax, use tax, and gross receipts tax on the same tax return as they report the state sales tax and use tax. Only one tax return is needed to report and remit both state and municipal tax. The following guides and publications are available:
