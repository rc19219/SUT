# Audit
![Business Owner Working](https://dor.sd.gov/media/mmumwmjz/business_shopowner.jpg)
If you are in business for any length of time, you can expect a visit from a Department of Revenue auditor. This is no cause for alarm; taxpayers are audited regularly, and you shouldn't feel that your account is under suspicion for any tax liability. In pursuant to [South Dakota law 10-59-5](http://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=10-59-5 "SDCL 10-59-5"), the South Dakota Department of Revenue reserves the right to conduct audits when the reported sales, use and/or excise tax varies significantly from what is expected. Our parameters are based on industry, location, past reporting and other factors. If you are currently involved with an audit, please [contact your local auditor](https://dor.sd.gov/contact/ "Contact Auditor") for more detailed information.

## Record Retention
In accordance with[ Administrative Rule 64:06:01:35](https://sdlegislature.gov/Rules/Administrative/21047 "Administrative Rule 64:06:01:35"), if selected for examination, business records supporting your tax liability will be requested by the auditor and must be provided within 60 days of the audit commencement date. All businesses should maintain these records for at least the current month and the previous 36 months. Records that should be retained include:
### Gross Receipts
  * Sales and billing invoices
  * General and subsidiary ledgers
  * Cash register tapes - journal tapes, detail tapes, Z tapes, guest checks
  * Bank deposit slips and statements
  * Sales and/or cash receipts journal
  * Contracts


### Deductions Support
  * Resale certificates
  * Proof of exemption (exemption certificate or proof of government funds)
  * Bills of lading or other proof of delivery
  * Credit memorandums
  * Bad debts as claimed on federal income tax returns


### Use Tax
  * Purchase Invoices
  * Cash Disbursement Journal or Check Register
  * Fixed Assets Schedule
  * Inventory withdrawal records
  * Depreciation Schedules


## What To Do if Your Business is Selected
If your business is selected for an examination, you will receive a Notice of Intent to Audit at least 30 days before the commencement of the audit. Once the notice is received, all records should be procured for the return periods on the notice of intent. Unlicensed businesses and businesses convicted of tax fraud are not limited to a three-year look back and may be audited from the start of their business forward. Anyone who fails or refuses to exhibit the records and books required to the Department of Revenue for examination could be found guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
## Appealing an Audit
If you believe your assessment is based on a mistake of fact or an error of law, a written request for hearing must be mailed within 60 days from the date of the Certificate of Assessment was mailed to you. See the [Audit Tax Facts (PDF)](https://dor.sd.gov/media/y4wlbawx/audits.pdf "Tax Fact Audits") to learn more.
## Have a Question About Your Audit?
If you have received a notice of intent, are currently involved with an audit and have a question please contact your auditor or their supervisor.

## Interest & Penalty
Interest is assessed anytime the tax obligation is under paid. It is assessed at a rate of 1% per month or partial month, the tax obligation remains outstanding. If the failure to pay the tax was with the intent to avoid or delay the payment of tax, a rate of 1.5% per month will be assessed. A penalty of 10% of the tax will be assessed on errors related to any return that was not filed with 30 days of the return due date.

### Common Fuel Tax Errors
  1. Errors in reporting due to poor record keeping.
  2. Not keeping the nine required items on trip sheets. (IFTA/IRP)
  3. Not using bill of lading as main source document. (Ex. should not substitute invoice, etc.) (Supplier)
  4. Not including non-taxable exports on returns. (Importer/Exporter/Supplier)
  5. Incorrect reporting of product authorizations – a product authorization must occur before the rack and bill of lading must reflect the new supplier.
