## Where Does the Money Go?
The South Dakota Lottery is run like any other business. We take revenue in, we account for expenses, and whatever is left over is our net income. Unlike other businesses, however, our net income goes back to South Dakota to pay for things important to South Dakotans.
![Person Scratching a Ticket](https://dor.sd.gov/media/f1dfmjoq/entertainment_scratchoff.jpg)
### Funding Education
The Lottery has provided more than $773 million to the state General Fund. Each year, nearly half of the entire General Fund is used to support local K-12 schools and state universities and technical institutes.
### Developing Natural Resources
The Lottery has provided more than $100 million to the Capital Construction Fund. Local communities use these funds to pay for rural water systems, community drinking water and wastewater improvement projects, plus recycling and waste disposal programs.
### Promoting Responsible Gaming
The Lottery has also provided $4.1 million to the S.D. Department of Social Services for problem gambling treatment services.
