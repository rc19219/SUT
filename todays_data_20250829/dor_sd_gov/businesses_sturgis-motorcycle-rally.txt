## Step 1: Apply for a Temporary South Dakota Sales Tax License
  * All vendors must have a [Temporary South Dakota Sales Tax License](https://dorresources.sd.gov/f/SturgisRallyApp "Temporary SD Sales Tax License Application") for selling or displaying a product or for providing services at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. **You must complete a new application each year.**
  * If you have a Permanent South Dakota Sales Tax license, but are operating in a temporary location during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, you also need to apply for the [Temporary South Dakota Sales Tax License](https://dorresources.sd.gov/f/SturgisRallyApp "Temporary SD Sales Tax License Application")[](https://dorresources.sd.gov/f/SturgisRallyApp).


Applications for the 2025 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally are currently being accepted.
[Apply Now](https://dorresources.sd.gov/f/SturgisRallyApp "Temporary South Dakota Sales Tax License Application")
## Step 2: Determine if You Need to Post a Bond
  * If you are a first-time vendor, you must post a $500 bond.
  * If you attended last year’s rally and filed and paid your sales taxes on time, you do not need to post a bond.
  * If you filed or paid your sales tax after the due date in the prior year, you will need to post a bond. Please contact the Department of Revenue at [(605) 394-2332](tel:6053942332 "Call \(605\) 394-2332") to determine bond amount.
  * If you were a vendor in the past but did not attend in the prior year, you will need to post a $500 bond.
  * We accept cash, cashier’s check, money order or credit card. There is a non-refundable processing fee of 2.45% to use a credit card.
  * Bond is held as a deposit and will be mailed back to you when the rally has ended, and your final sales tax return has been filed and proper sales tax has been paid.


## Step 3: Send Application and Bond (if needed) to SD Department of Revenue
### Receive Your Temporary South Dakota Sales Tax License Card and Information Packet
  * **Pre-registration is available beginning March 1, 2025**. Your license card and information will be emailed to you. Bond (if needed, see Step 2) must be received by the Department of Revenue before the license card can be emailed.
  * **Please bring your license card with you** when you come to the rally. If you need a copy of your license card, we can print one for you. Please stop in our office.
  * Our temporary office at [City of Sturgis](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1040+2nd+St,+Sturgis,+SD+57785/@44.4137179,-103.5145391,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x532d5b85ad1f5bc1:0x9b64e82865f9aa77!8m2!3d44.4137179!4d-103.5123504 "Google Maps: Temp office in Sturgis") at 1040 Harley-Davidson Way will open in August 2025. Please review the office hours for the Department of Revenue’s office at Sturgis City Hall.


## Sturgis Room Rentals
Individuals renting a room in their home for 10+ days per year are subject to sales tax. The current rate is 8.7%, which includes 4.2% state tax, 1.5% tourism tax, and 3% Sturgis municipal tax. Municipal tax does not apply if the home is outside Sturgis city limits. If you rent rooms for 10+ days per year, you must obtain a [Temporary South Dakota Sales Tax License](https://dorresources.sd.gov/f/SturgisRallyApp "Temporary SD Sales Tax License Application") for the Sturgis Rally and pay the appropriate tax. If you have any questions, please consult the [live chat feature](https://dor.sd.gov/online-services/live-chat/ "Live Chat") or contact our Rapid City office at [(605) 394-2332](tel:6053942332 "Call \(605\) 394-2332").
## Motor Vehicles
### Are you Displaying or Selling:
  * Motorcycles
  * Off-road Vehicles
  * Trailers
  * Cars, Trucks or RVs


If so, you are required to buy a Special Event Permit from the Motor Vehicle Division.
**Cost:**
  * $250 if purchased before the event
  * $500 if purchased during the event


[Complete Form](https://my605Drive.sd.gov/eservices "605 Drive E-services")
From the my605Drive website, select the Special Event Permit Application in the Dealerships tile. 
## Cigarettes & Other Tobacco Products
If you or your company plan on selling cigarettes or other tobacco products, you should know:
  * Cigarettes **must** be purchased from a SD distributor who must tax stamp each pack. It is illegal to sell cigarettes in SD that do not have the tax stamp. Sales tax is due on the selling price of cigarettes.
  * If cigars and other tobacco products are purchased from a non-SD distributor, you **must** pay the 35% tobacco products tax on the purchase price. Please contact our office for the proper forms. Sales tax is also due on the selling price.
  * If you will be giving away tobacco products for free, you must pay the sales and use tax on the price of the products.

### Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Frequently Asked Questions
See what other vendors are asking about the Sturgis Motor Cycle Rally.
#####  Do I need a sales tax license & how do I get one? 
**All concessionaires** must obtain a temporary SD sales tax license for each business location, including Sturgis, Rapid City, Spearfish, Custer or any other cities in the Black Hills area. This also includes locations outside of city limits. Under no circumstances will any vendor be allowed to make any sales before being licensed.
To obtain the temporary license in advance of the rally contact the Rapid City office of the SD Department of Revenue at [(605) 394-2332](tel:6053942332 "Call \(605\) 394-2332") or [submit an application here](https://dorresources.sd.gov/f/SturgisRallyApp "Temp license application"). If you do not wish to obtain the license in advance you may contact [The Department of Revenue at Sturgis City Hall, 1040 Harley-Davidson Way, Sturgis SD](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//1040+Harley-Davidson+Way,+Sturgis,+SD+57785/@44.4137213,-103.5949885,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x532d5b85ade21c99:0xd6a4e8f0e5fb5de7!2m2!1d-103.5125351!2d44.4137493?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDMwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D "Google Maps: DOR at Sturgis City Hall"), beginning the week before the rally between the hours of 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.
#####  If I have a permanent SD tax license can I just report and pay my taxes on my permanent return form? 
No, if you are in a temporary location, even if you have a permanent SD license, you must obtain a temporary license and pay your taxes to the Department of Revenue at Sturgis City Hall during the rally.
#####  Do I need a sales tax license if I sell or display motorcycles or trailers? 
Yes, all vendors need to display a temporary license card whether they owe tax or not. Vendors selling or displaying motorcycles, trailers, or other vehicles also need to obtain a Temporary Motor Vehicle Dealer permit. Some restrictions apply and there is a fee for this permit. Please see the [Application for Temporary Manufacturer, Customizer or Dealer Special Event](https://dorresources.sd.gov/f/1406 "Application for Temporary Manufacturer, Customizer or Dealer Special Event").
#####  How much does a license cost? 
There is no cost for a license, but all new concessionaires and concessionaires with poor reporting histories will be required to post a bond before being licensed to sell merchandise, food or services at the rally. Bond amounts are at least $500 depending on the past history of the business. The department reserves the right to require a bond from any vendor.
#####  Is the bond refundable? 
Yes, once you have paid all of your taxes at the rally the bond is refunded as long as you return the bond receipt.
#####  Can I just deduct the amount of tax owed from the bond? 
No. You must pay your taxes according to the filing schedule. Bond is held as a deposit and will be mailed back to you when the rally has ended and your final sales tax return has been filed and proper sales tax has been paid.
#####  When and where do I pay my taxes? 
Taxes are to be paid either electronically or directly to the Department of Revenue at Sturgis City Hall during the week of the rally. If you are located in Rapid City or any city in the Southern Black Hills other arrangements may be made by the Department to pay the taxes.
#####  Can I just pay on my last day of the Sturgis Rally? 
No, vendors are required to pay according to a schedule of collection days. If they leave early they are to pay their final taxes before they leave. The bond is not refunded until the final taxes are paid.
#####  What is the tax rate? 
Items or Services (not including food): 
  * Sturgis, Deadwood, Lead, Spearfish, Custer, Hill City, Whitewood, Keystone: 7.7%, Food is 8.7%.
  * Rapid City: 7.7%, Food is 8.7%
  * Hot Springs: 7.7%, Food is 8.7%
  * Belle Fourche: 7.7%, Food is 8.7%
  * Newell: 7.7% for both food & other items


If your business is located outside of city limits the rate is 5.7% for both food and general items and services.
These tax rates are effective as of January 1, 2021.
#####  Can I just get one license for all of my locations? 
No, one license for EACH location is required. But only one bond will be required.
#####  What kinds of records do I need to keep? 
Inventory records, a daily cash sheet, cash register tapes, credit card receipts, bank deposit slips, purchase invoices, sales receipts and supplier lists. Revenue auditors may stop at your location to review your records.
[SDCL 10-45-88](http://sdlegislature.gov/statutes/Codified_laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Statute=10-45-88&Type=Statute "SDCL 10-45-88") states that temporary vendors operating in South Dakota may be subjected to reviews without notice and shall have all records available at all times for review. The records that shall be available at all times include sales receipts, credit card receipts, cash register tapes, inventory sheets, and invoices from suppliers.
Failure to maintain records is a Class 1 misdemeanor and can result in the immediate revocation of the temporary license.
