## Electronic Lien & Title (ELT)
### What is the ELT System?
The South Dakota Motor Vehicle Division has an Electronic Lien & Title System (ELT), which allows lienholders to reduce the handling, storage and mailing costs of paper titles by replacing them with an electronic version. No paper title will be printed while there is a lien noted, unless one of the exceptions in South Dakota law apply. [SDCL 32-3-70](http://sdlegislature.gov/statutes/Codified_laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Statute=32-3-70&Type=Statute "SDCL 32-3-70")
### How Does the ELT System Work?
Lenders have the option to utilize a third-party provider that will provide electronic notices of title issuance and lien perfection when a record is issued in the state system. Upon the release of a lien, a participating lender will send a lien release electronically through its provider. Upon receipt of the electronic lien release, the title will be printed and mailed to the owner, unless directed otherwise by the lender. For more information on the Electronic Lien & Title system, take a look at the [ELT Guide (PDF)](https://dor.sd.gov/media/jkbnwr0z/sd-elt-guide.pdf "SD ELT Guide"). 
### Notation of Liens on Existing South Dakota Printed Titles
To have a lien noted on an outstanding title, the owner or lienholder shall present the original South Dakota certificate of title (or valid duplicate) and a copy of the security agreement to the titled owner’s county treasurer’s office. A lien notation fee of $10 must also be submitted. **Note** : the check or money order must be made out to the appropriate county treasurer (not to the Motor Vehicle Division).
### Release of Liens on Printed South Dakota Titles
The signature of the lienholder on the face of the certificate of title is not needed if there is a notice of the satisfaction for liens noted on a South Dakota certificate of title. **Note** : while liens can be canceled in any county, lien notations must be made in the titled owner’s county of record.
#### On Titles Which Are Held by the Lienholder
It is the responsibility of the lienholder to have the lien against the record holder released by the county treasurer within 20 days after final payment. No fee is assessed for the release of a lien.
#### On Titles Which Are Held by the Owner
It is the responsibility of the lienholder to execute a release within 20 days after final payment is received. The lienholder shall mail or deliver the release to the owner. The certificate of title and lien release shall be forwarded by the owner to any county treasurer. No fee is assessed for the release of a lien.
## Repossession Vehicles
### How to Apply
Financial Institutions looking to apply for a repossession title will need to submit the following documents to their local county treasury's office in the county the vehicle was issued. To complete this transaction, please include:
  1. Copy of Security Agreement
  2. [Application for Motor Vehicle/Boat Title Registration ](https://sddor.seamlessdocs.com/f/1001 "Application for Motor Vehicle/Boat Title Registration")[](https://sddor.seamlessdocs.com/f/1001)

Submit the form and payment to the local county treasurer’s office[](https://www.google.com/maps/place/445+E+Capitol+Ave,+Pierre,+SD+57501/@44.3657562,-100.348598,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8780121e8d3288c7:0x5ded4914dcba1b29!8m2!3d44.3657562!4d-100.3464093).
#####  What if my address has changed? 
Contact your [local county treasurer's office](https://dor.sd.gov/government/county-treasurers/contact-county-treasurers/ "Contact County Treasurers") to change your address in your customer record or visit the online [Vehicle Registration & Plates portal](https://dor.sd.gov/online-services/vehicle-registration-plates/ "Vehicle Registration & Plates portal").
#####  How do I replace a damaged or lost license plate or tags? 
Contact your [local county treasurer’s office](https://dor.sd.gov/government/county-treasurers/contact-county-treasurers/ "Contact County Treasurers") to complete an [Affidavit for Duplicate License Plate/Validation Sticker](https://sddor.seamlessdocs.com/f/1308 "Affidavit for duplicate License Plates or Registration")[](https://dorresources.sd.gov/f/1823). Fees can be found on the form.
#####  Can I get an extension on the 45 day requirement to title and register a newly purchased vehicle? 
Effective July 1, 2015, vehicle owners have 45 days to apply for title and registration of an acquired vehicle. All vehicles acquired prior to July 1, 2015 must have been titled and registered within 30 days of the purchase date.
There is not a provision for extensions on the 45 day requirement. Interest and penalties will accrue on the motor vehicle excise tax. All fees are assessed from the purchase date regardless of when an applicant applies for title and registration.
Interest is at a rate of 1 percent or $5, whichever is greater, for the first month; and 1 percent per month thereafter on any application made after 45 days from the date of purchase. (Interest is not calculated on interest.) A one-time penalty equal to 10 percent of the tax or $10, whichever is greater, is automatically applied against any application made after 60 days from the purchase date.
An applicant will be charged title late fees at a rate of $1 per week up until the 24th week. If the applicant is over this date, the rate automatically maxes to a fee of $50.
#####  Do I pay motor vehicle excise tax if I transfer a title to my child? 
No, you don’t. A vehicle is exempt from tax when it is transferred without consideration (no money is exchanged) between spouses, between a parent and child and between siblings. A title transfer fee of $10.00 will apply.
#####  What do I do with my license plates from my old car when I purchase a new car? 
South Dakota is a plate with owner state. This means that the license plates are retained by the owner. If you purchase a new vehicle, you will transfer the license plates from your old vehicle to your newly acquired vehicle. You can do this at your [local county treasurer's office](https://dor.sd.gov/government/county-treasurers/contact-county-treasurers/ "County Treasurers Information"). Be sure to take your old plates with you to the county treasurer's office.
#####  I sold my vehicle privately to an individual, how do I print a seller’s permit for the new owner? 
A seller’s permit allows the new owner to drive legally while waiting to apply for title. A seller's permit may be printed by the seller through the online [Vehicle Registration & Plates portal](https://dor.sd.gov/online-services/vehicle-registration-plates/ "Vehicle Registration & Plates portal") or may also be obtained at your [local county treasurer's office](https://dor.sd.gov/government/county-treasurers/contact-county-treasurers/ "County Treasurers Information"). The seller's permit is valid for 45 days. The seller has 45 days to deliver title.
#####  What is the damage disclosure? 
State law requires that upon the sale, transfer or trade in of a motor vehicle or large boat, the person who sells, transfers or trades the vehicle or large boat, must provide a completed Damage Disclosure Statement to the person to whom the vehicle or large boat is transferred. If a motor vehicle or large boat, which is titled in another jurisdiction, is to be titled in South Dakota, the person who registers the vehicle or large boat (importer) must also complete a Damage Disclosure Statement.
Effective July 1, 2015, damage disclosure is no longer mandated. Damage disclosure will remain noted on titles issued before July 1, 2015.
#####  What do I need to do if I move to South Dakota from out of state? 
If you have titled and licensed your vehicles in another state, you will be granted reciprocity when you come to South Dakota and will not have to pay any additional tax if your state’s tax rate is above South Dakota’s 4% tax rate. If a state with no tax or a lower tax rate than South Dakota’s 4%, then you will need to pay the additional tax rate to match the 4%. You have 90 days from your date of arrival to title and license your vehicle in South Dakota.
#####  Can I register my vehicle in South Dakota if I live out of state? 
You should know that your state may prohibit registering your vehicle in another state.
You will need your original out of state titles, a copy of your state driver license, social security number, and a [Motor Vehicle and Boat Title & Registration Application](https://sddor.seamlessdocs.com/f/1001 "Motor Vehicle or Boat Title & Registration Application"). Take this paperwork to your [local county treasurer's office](https://dor.sd.gov/government/county-treasurers/contact-county-treasurers/ "County Treasurers Information") to complete registration process. They will be able to tell you the appropriate fees pertaining to that county.
#####  What do I do if I purchased an ATV? 
In South Dakota an ATV MUST be titled. If purchased in South Dakota, an ATV is subject to the 4% motor vehicle excise tax. However, if purchased by an out of state business, you will need to show proof of tax paid to your local Department of Revenue office. 
#####  How do I do a title search on a vehicle that was registered in South Dakota? 
You will need to complete a Drivers Privacy Protection Application (DPPA). Submit completed forms to your [local county treasurer’s office](https://dor.sd.gov/government/county-treasurers/contact-county-treasurers/ "County Treasurers Information") or mail to the SD Motor Vehicle Division in Pierre (address can be found in [contact us](https://dor.sd.gov/contact/ "Contact Information") area). You must qualify to receive this information with one of the following reasons: 
  1. For use by any government agency
  2. For any state authorized purpose relating to the operation of a motor vehicle, public safety or for use in connection with car safety, prevention of car theft, and promotion of driver safety
  3. For use by a business to verify the accuracy of personal information submitted to that business to prevent fraud or pursue legal remedies
  4. In connection with court, agency or self-regulatory body proceedings
  5. For use by insurers in connection with claims investigations, antifraud activities, rating or underwriting
  6. To notify vehicle owners that their vehicle has been towed or impounded
  7. For use by a licensed private investigative agencies or security services for any purpose by the DPPA


#####  How do I confirm a lien on a vehicle? 
You'll start by visiting [www.sdcars.org](http://www.sdcars.org/ "Visit www.sdcars.org"). Click the VIN CHECK icon, enter a vehicle identification number (VIN) and you will see if there is a lienholder on that vehicle.
#####  What do I need to sell a vehicle? 
You will need the [Bill of Sale](https://dorresources.sd.gov/f/1025 "Bill of Sale").
#####  I sold my vehicle, how do I report the sale? 
Log into the online [Vehicle Registration & Plates portal](https://dor.sd.gov/online-services/vehicle-registration-plates/ "Vehicle Registration & Plates portal"), select the vehicle that was sold and choose report of sale in the dropdown menu.
#####  How many vehicles can I sell before I need a dealer’s license? 
People who engage in the business of selling vehicles, whether exclusively or in addition to another occupation, are required to have a [motor vehicle dealer license](https://dor.sd.gov/businesses/motor-vehicle/dealer-vehicle-licenses/ "Dealer Vehicle Licenses").
#####  How do I get a dealer’s license? 
Visit the [vehicle dealer section](https://dor.sd.gov/businesses/motor-vehicle/dealer-vehicle-licenses/ "Dealer Vehicle Licenses") of our page and apply.
#####  What is ELT? 
ELT stands for Electronic Lien Title. When you have a lienholder on your vehicle loan, your title will remain in an electronic form only until the time your loan is paid off and the lienholder releases their interest in your vehicle. At that time a paper title will be printed and mailed to the location indicated by the lienholder in the release. South Dakota has been an ELT state since October 2012.
#####  What does an ELT provider do? 
When a title record is issued with a lien or a new lien is perfected, the provider supplies the lender with an electronic message of the lien perfection. When a lien is needed to be released, the lender would send an electronic lien release to the Motor Vehicle Division through the provider. Providers also supply other services for their lenders.
#####  What is the cost to use an ELT provider? 
The ELT vendors provide several different options for your business, so we would suggest that you contact them directly to determine the costs that will be associated with your participation in the ELT program.
#####  Does a Lender have to use a Provider? 
No, if the lender chooses to not use a provider, no notice is sent to the lender regarding any lien perfections.
#####  How does a lender note a lien if not using a provider? 
If there is a current title document, the title along with the loan contract and $10.00 lien fee is submitted to the titled owner’s county treasurer’s office. The county will note the lien in the system and keep the title. If the title is already electronic, the loan contract and $10.00 fee is remitted to the county treasurer and lien is noted.
#####  If a lender does not utilize a provider, what do they get for a notice of lien perfection? 
The lender receives no notification. The lender will be able to verify lien perfection by checking the VIN in the online [Vehicle Registration & Plates portal](https://dor.sd.gov/online-services/vehicle-registration-plates/ "Vehicle Registration & Plates portal").
#####  How does a lender note a second (junior) lien on an existing ELT record? 
If the title is already electronic, the loan contract and $10.00 fee is remitted to the owner’s [local county treasurer’s office](https://dor.sd.gov/government/county-treasurers/contact-county-treasurers/ "County Treasurers Information"), and the lien is noted.
#####  Who should I contact if I have questions about the ELT process? 
For questions about the Electronic Lien & Title process, please email us at DOR.DMVELT@state.sd.us.
